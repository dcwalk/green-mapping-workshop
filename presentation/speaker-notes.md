# Slide 0: Introduction
# Slide 1: My Introduction and Research Ethics
__0:05__
Hi everyone, thank you for coming today! I'm really looking forward to this afternoon, just a little bit about me. My name is Dawn Walker, I'm a grad student here at the University of Toronto, ...Faculty of Information.

My area of study is Information System Design, and this workshop is part of my research design project on how to design online community maps to support discovery of urban agriculture and sustainability initiatives.

Given that this workshop is being held as part of my research I have to cover a few quick details, you all should have a letter which outlines my obligations to you as a participant in the study:
+ In any reports created individuals will remain anonymous unless you give me explicit permission.
+ Participation is entirely voluntary and at any time you can stop and ask to have your information removed.
+ There is no compensation for participation in this project.

## Introductions Activity
=========================

*Materials*: none
*Time*: 10 minutes or less
*Instructions*:
+ Ask participants to go around the room and provide their first name

First name & Goal for the workshop


# Slide 2: Workshop Objectives
__0:25__
I think today is ambitious but we have time to get a lot done!

In 3 hours we will...
+ learn about online mapping and green map projects
+ look at and test existing mapping tools
+ prototype maps and put them online!

# Slide 3: What is meant by 'Green Map'?
I'll talk a bit at the beginning but we'll soon jump into the activities. First I thought we might want to start with some concepts...

So, what is meant by the term green map?

I took two different descriptions of what a green map is...

1. According to Green Map Systems, *green maps* are:

    “locally created environmentally themed maps...plot[ting] the locations of a community's natural, cultural and sustainable resources”

2. TransforMap sees *green maps* as highlighting:

    “the initiatives, communities, projects... dedicated to... serving the common good and/ or contributing to a sustainable way of life”

# Slide 4: Map Examples
Because I said this workshop would be online, I chose a few examples to suit:

- Open Green Map
- NYC Street Trees
- Toronto Community Garden Network

Does anyone else have a project in mind they would consider a green map?

# Slide 5: Web Maps
Okay, so sort of have a handle on what a green map might be, but more generally, what about web maps?

I've pulled together a definition which I think is succinct but also still meaningful:

		a web map is a kind of __digital map__... made with a computer and __available on the internet__, that you can view in a browser

This relies upon a great presentation, linked from the slide, called "Anatomy of a Map" which I've included in the resources for this presentation

I have 4 popular web map services in the background:
- Bing
- Google Maps
- Mapquest (now uses Open Street Map Data)
- Open Street Map

# Slide 6: Types (or Features) of Web Maps

It gets complicated when people try to classify types of web maps. An original distinction drawn between types still seems to be the main differentiating feature:
*whether a map is Static versus Dynamic*

but new 'dynamic' features have emerged and most maps have some slightly unique combination of *interactivity, real-time updating, or animation*


# Slide 7: Parts of a Web Map
There are a lot of different parts of web maps, but the most important to cover are:
- tiles
- levels (or zoom levels) and
- layers

## Tiles
- tiles are one of the key parts that allow web maps to be dynamic, original web maps were static, and the whole page would have to be reloaded if you wanted to move around (think early mapquest). In 2005, google maps launched and used tiles (of a uniform 256x256 pixels square), to allow parts of the map to load at different times.

These are pre-rendered and stored/served as images on the web.

## Zoom Levels
- related to tiles, web maps have different levels (of 'zoomed in') showing more or less detail, this is true whether the map is showing satellite images (like the background), or if the map is represented more abstractly.

Zoom levels are linked to tiles, as an example, I pulled three tiles showing the portion of Open Street Map covering this building, but at different zoom levels.

If you notice, they are all the same size, but show less area and more detail depending on the level of zoom

## Layers
Finally layers. Tiles and zoom levels are almost always just referring to the basemap layer.

When you first arrive at Google Maps, before you search for anything, you are usually just looking at the basemap.

Additional data layers are where information about features, points of interest, areas, and routes lives.

In terms of mapping, and green mapping in particular, almost always, the content or features being mapped are going into data layers.

# Slide 8: Making a Web Map
There are lots of tools! (overwhelming)
Some help you do everything and others only help with one small piece most could be considered Geographic Information Systems

I went straight to wikipedia for this one:
*GIS are “designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of spatial or geographical data”*

# Slide 9: Tool Examples
Given the amount of time we have and that this is an intro workshop I'm going to focus on the everything tools, but in the resources page I have links out to a lot more!

I'm going through this quick because we will get to dig into some of these in a later activity:
- MapBox
- CartoDB
- ArcGIS
- Google Developer Maps... this is kind of an odd one, you can do a lot with Google Maps and the Google Developers support to achieve the same as the above tools
- Just one shout out to a single-purpose tool: leaflet.js
